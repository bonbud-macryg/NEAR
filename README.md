# NEAR x Urbit Labs

The NEAR BOS has a thriving ecosystem of developers and an innovative method for composing frontends via components stored on the NEAR blockchain. Urbit can enhance the BOS by acting as a private server that new components can interact with, unlocking decentralized interfaces populated by personal data.

To enable these new components, Urbit Labs is forking the NEAR Social VM and adding a new Urbit object with methods that wrap the @urbit/http-api library.
